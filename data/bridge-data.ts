This conversation developed a comprehensive framework for Claude to better align with Evan's FLOAT cognitive architecture, including: 1) Enhanced understanding of ctx:: markers as temporal-cognitive anchors, 2) Recognition of persona system (Karen, Sysop, Raw Evan, qtb, lf1m), 3) Detailed cognitive states (brain boot, hyperfocus, evening work mode, etc.), 4) Core FLOAT philosophy ('Trust the drift, defer the scaffold', 'Anchor what's real, not what's ideal', 'Shacks, not Cathedrals'), 5) Rich understanding of 'Composting Chaos' as survival mechanism, 6) MCP tool ambient awareness patterns for more seamless integration, 7) Context bootstrapping process for efficient operation.",
