      "In FLOAT, systems are viewed as relationship networks, not just technical implementations. This perspective sees form fields not merely as data containers but as moments of care - touchpoints where practitioners interact with patients through the medium of technology. The quality of these touchpoints directly impacts the quality of care delivered.",

      "Workspace Schema defines the cognitive environment through YAML with named fields, memory locations, agent definitions, layout configurations, and daemon services. This structured approach creates a consistent yet flexible framework for knowledge work, similar to how a well-designed form schema enables clinicians to focus on patient care rather than data entry mechanics.",
